JWT
    - These are JSON Web Tokens
    - They are used in the process of Authorization
    - Authorization is the process of ensuring a particular user is still that user after they have been authenticated

    - usually Authorization is achieved through session ids in the cookies of the browser
        - they are sent between the server and client to verify requests 
        - ex.
            CLI => SRV : POST /user/login {email, password}
                SRV : Stores User In Session Server Memory 
                SRV => CLI : Sends a Session ID as a Cookie
            CLI => SRV : Send Request with Session ID Cookie 
                SRV : Get User From Session Based On ID And Verify Them
                SRV => CLI : Sends Response
    
    - jwt is for the same use case
        - ex. 
            CLI => SRV : POST /user/login {email, password}
                SRV : Creates a JWT for user with secret
                SRV => CLI : Sends JWT to client
            CLI => SRV : Send Request with JWT  
                SRV : Verify JWT signature and get user from JWT 
                SRV => CLI : Sends Response
        
        - nothing is stored on the server
        - the JWT is used to authenticate itself 
        - very useful for multi server applications
