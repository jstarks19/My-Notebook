Bcrypt
    - this is a node module that gives us access to cyptographic tools
    - hash : this is a one-way function 
        - useful in hashing passwords
        - however, if multiple users have the same password, the hash will be the same, not good for security
    - salt : this is a small string used to make hashes unique
        - this fixes the password issue
