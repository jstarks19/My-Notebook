Babel

    What is it????
        - Babel is a JavaScript Transpiler
        - It converts the current JavaScript into the older (and more compatible) ES5 format

    How to install it?
        $ npm i -D @babel/core @babel/cli

        Why install it as a local dependency?
            1) Different projects on the same machine can depend on different versions of Babel allowing you to update one at a time
            2) No implicit dependency on the environment you are working in. Making your project far more portable
    
    How to use it?
        - often you will want to include a script for babel in your package.json config
            i.e. 
            "scripts":{
                "build": "babel src -d lib"
            }
        
        - after that, you want to install the preset environment for babel
            - the preset-env is a general environment set up for ES2015+
            $ npm i -D @babel/preset-env
        
        - after that, you need to setup a babel.config.json file
            {
                "presets": ["@abbel/preset-env"]
            }
