Grid

    A CSS display format that is specifically built for laying out content


    Terminology:

        Grid Container 
            - direct parent of all of the grid items
            - whichever element has the display: grid property set

        Grid Item
            - children of the grid container
            - direct descendants of the grid container

        Grid Line
            - The dividing lines that make up the structure of the grid
            - can be vertical (column grid lines) or horizontal (row grid lines)

        Grid Cell
            - Basically any naturally divided cell produced from the grid lines
            - most often these will contain elements (grid items)

        Grid Track
            - space between two adjacent grid lines

        Grid Area 
            - total space surrounded by four grid lines
            - not simply a cell or a block of four, ANY four grid lines that form a box


    Properties for Parent

        display: [ grid | inline-grid ]
            - this creates a grid element/container
        
        grid-template-columns
        grid-template-rows
            - defines the columns and rows of the grid with space seperated values
            - the values represent track sizes while the space between could be representative of the grid lines
            options:
                <track-size> : can be a length, percentage, or fraction of free space
                <line-name>  : an arbitrary name of your choosing
            - in order to add names to grid lines, you must use bracket syntax
                i.e : grid-template-columns: [first] 10px [line2] 10px [line3]
            - you can include: repeat(3, 20px) to repeat a 20px track 3 times 

        grid-template-areas
            - defines a template by referencing the names of the grid areas
                - grid areas are specified using the grid-area property name
            options
                <grid-area-name> : name of the grid area 
                .       : an empty grid cell
                none    : no grid areas 
        
        grid-template
            - shorthand for grid-template-rows, grid-template-columns, and grid-template-areas
        
        justify-items: [ start | end | center | stretch ]
            - aligns items along the inline axis (horizontally)
        
        align-items: [ start | end | center | stretch ]
            - aligns items along the perp axis (vertically)
        
        place-items: [start | end | center | stretch ]
            - basically a shortcut for both justify & align items in one line

        justify-content: [ start | end | center | stretch | space-around | space-between | space-evenly ]
            - if your items don't take up the entire grid container HORIZONTALLY
            - this will let you place them within the parent 
        
        align-content: [ start | end | ... ]
            - if your items don't take up the entire grid container VERTICALLY
                - you can align the items with this 
        
        place-content: [ start | end | center | ... ]
            - shorthand for both align & justify content 


        grid-auto-columns: 
        grid-auto-rows: 
            - used to specify the size of any auto-generated grid tracks 
                - those not explicitly defined 
        
        grid-auto-flow: [ row | column ]
            - tells grid when making a new implicit space to either choose a new row or col to add

        grid-column-end: ...
        grid-row-start: ...

            - specifies the location for the grid item within the grid container
        
        grid-column: [ start line / end line | start line / span value ]
        grid-row: ...
            - shorthand for grid-col/row-start/end but in one line 

        grid area: [ name | row start / column start / row end / column end ]
