Grid

    A CSS display format that is specifically built for laying out content


    Terminology:

        Grid Container 
            - direct parent of all of the grid items
            - whichever element has the display: grid property set

        Grid Item
            - children of the grid container
            - direct descendants of the grid container

        Grid Line
            - The dividing lines that make up the structure of the grid
            - can be vertical (column grid lines) or horizontal (row grid lines)

        Grid Cell
            - Basically any naturally divided cell produced from the grid lines
            - most often these will contain elements (grid items)

        Grid Track
            - space between two adjacent grid lines

        Grid Area 
            - total space surrounded by four grid lines
            - not simply a cell or a block of four, ANY four grid lines that form a box


    Properties for Parent

        display: grid | inline-grid
            - this creates a grid element/container
        
        grid-template-columns
        grid-template-rows
            - defines the columns and rows of the grid with space seperated values
            - the values represent track sizes while the space between could be representative of the grid lines
            options:
                <track-size> : can be a length, percentage, or fraction of free space
                <line-name>  : an arbitrary name of your choosing
            - in order to add names to grid lines, you must use bracket syntax
                i.e : grid-template-columns: [first] 10px [line2] 10px [line3]
            - you can include: repeat(3, 20px) to repeat a 20px track 3 times
