    Best Units for Responsive Design
        - rem
            - relative to the root element 
            - commonly used for font sizes 
            - default font size is 16px
        - em
            - related to the font size of the current element
            - often used with padding and margin bc of font differences
        - %
            - relative to the parent element
            - often used as the width and height of an element 
            - rarely used for font sizes
            - very useful for responsive layouts

        -vw & vh
            - % of the current viewport height/width
            - vh useful for dividing content on a page
            - useful for an element whose size is dependant on the viewport
                - like a sidebar
                - or navbar
    
    Flex vs. Grid vs. Floating
        - THEY ARE ALL USEFUL
        - consider them all tools in your toolbelt 
    
        Flexbox 
            - lining things up in one direction
            - one line at a time
        
        Grid 
            - good for lining up things in more than one direction 
            - 2 directions at a time
            - one thing that grid brings to the table that flex does not
                - overlapping of elements
    
    Move away from standard 12 column bullshit
        - DESIGN

            - typography palettes
            - LAYOUT palettes
