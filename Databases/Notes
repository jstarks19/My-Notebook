Databases
    - Why do we even want a database in an application?
        - Persistence dummy
        - Why don't we use files?
            - We could, but databases are specifically designed to handle large amounts of data very efficiently
            - They store the data rather compactly
            - They already provide tools for insertion, deletion, updates, etc.
            - They generally will provide security
            - They (generally) scale well

SQL vs. NO-SQL
    - SQL 
        - Structured Query Language dbs are relational databases
        - we pre-define schema of tables before we insert anything
        - ex. MySQL, Postgres, SQLite, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server
    - NO-SQL
        - Do not use SQL 
        - There are many types of NO-SQL DBs (document, key-value, graphs)
        - ex. MongoDB, Couch DB, Neo4j, Cassandra, Redis
