HTML Notes

- It is a Markup Language
    - Not a programming language
- HTML5 is the latest standard (how browsers conform)

Block vs. Inline
    Block 
        - Takes up the entire content line (the entire width of the page) 
    Inline
        - Takes up only the space required for the element, does not break the page (unless too big)

HTML Entities 
    - Special sequences that result in different characters in HTML 
    - begins with an '&' and ends in a ';'
    - &copy;
    - Reserved Characters
        <, >, ', ", &
        - must use character codes for these 



Semantic HTML
    - meaningful markup
    Some tags
        <main>      : main content of the page
            - should exclude repeated content (i.e. sidebars, nav panel)
            - should be unique to the document 

        <header>    : header content
            - introductory content
            - navigational content

        <nav>       : navigation

        <section>   : a standalone section of an app or website
            - think heading & paragraph 
            - just a simple section of content

        <article>   : a self contained composition
            - independently usable or distributable piece of composition
            - should have a heading 

        <aside>     : non essential indirectly related content
            - think a sidebar or aside quote
            
        <footer>    : footer content
            - closing content
            - contact
            - navigation 
            - can have more than one per page
        
        <time>      : wrap around date/times
        
        <figure>    : Self contained content with optional caption
            <figcaption>

Advanced Topics

        - REALLY useful for SEO optimizations
        - basically a must for page ranking properly 

        SEO Meta Tags
            
            Must Haves

                - Meta content type
                    - necessary to declare the character set for your page
                    - should be present on every page

                    ex. <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" />

                - Title
                    - contains the title of your page
                    - one of the most important SEO tags
                    - you should have a unique title on every page that describes the page

                    ex. <title>Jason's Page</title>

                - Meta description
                    - used to describe the page to searchers on the results page
                    - does not influence page rank, but is very important, as it will be the reason your page is clicked
                    - should be kept below 160 characters & written to catch the user's attention

                    ex. <meta name="description" content="This page is focused on doing stuff" />
                
                - Viewport
                    - improves performance on mobile devices
                    - if you don't include the mobile experience will be shit

                    ex. <meta name=viewport content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />


    - b vs. strong tags
        - b is simply bolding the text
            - it is not semantically converying information
            - simply an aesthetic tag 
        - strong also bolds the text
            - strong is for providing urgency  
            
    
    - i vs. em
        - result in the same output
        - em is meant for emphasizing an important piece of text
        - i is simply for italicizing
