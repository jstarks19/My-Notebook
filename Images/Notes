    Responsive Images
        
        Two ways in which you can serve up images on the web
            1) based on pixel density (dpi)
                - 2x, 3x, retina displays 
                - we can serve an image based on this
            2) based on the width of the viewport
                - loading in different versions of the same image based the viewport of your device
                - tablets, smartphones, computer monitors, etc. 
                - using lower quality images on high res devices can lead to issues with edge blurring
                - by supplying smaller images at different viewports you also allow for reduced bandwidth
                    - instead of sending a 100k file to a mobile device, you only send a 1k file
    
        What is srcset?
            - a list of one or more strings separated by commas indicating a set of 
              possible image sources for the user agent to use
            - browsers are mostly capable of using srcset, but ones such as IE do not all support it
                - because of this always include a default src attribute
            ex.
                Good for a set width
                    <img src="img/img-500.jpg" 
                        srcset="img/img-500.jpg,
                                img/img-1000.jpg 2x,
                                img/img-1500.jpg 3x"
                        alt="">
                         
                More practical
                    <img src="img/img-500.jpg" 
                        srcset="img/img-500.jpg 500w,
                                img/img-1000.jpg 1000w,
                                img/img-1500.jpg 1500w"
                        alt="">


    
    Formats & More

        Raster Images
            - Pixel-based graphics 
            - Resolution dependent
            - Photos & Web Graphics

            JPG/JPEG
                - a "lossy" format
                - it will compress images at varying quality levels (user specified)
                - does not support transparency
                - file sizes are very small in comparison to other compression formats
                - use cases
                    - photographs, artwork, emailing graphics (since file sizes are smaller), large banner ads 
                - don't use for
                    - transparent images, multiple image layers (everything in a jpg is saved as a single layer)

            PNG
                - a "lossless" compression format
                - no variance in quality as quality is preserved
                - supports transparency
                - file sizes are smaller than the original, but significantly larger than say JPG 
                - use cases
                    - text, high quality transparent graphics, line art, limited color palette, small file size 
                - don't use for
                    - photos or artwork (file sizes will be way too big), need to print the image

            GIF
                - a "lossless" raster format 
                - used to include animated clips

                - use cases
                    - animated graphics, banner ads, very small file size needs, and social media memes 
                - don't use for 
                    - high quality images, printing an image, need layers to be editable

            TIFF/TIF
                - a "lossless" raster format
                - extremely high quality images

                - don't use for
                    - web graphics (file sizes too large and they are meant to be printed)
            
            Raw 
                - unprocessed data captured by a digital camera
                - typically raw images are processed and then converted to another format (TIFF, JPG)

                - typical raw formats are CRW, NEF, DNG
