    Responsive Images
        
        Two ways in which you can serve up images on the web
            1) based on pixel density (dpi)
                - 2x, 3x, retina displays 
                - we can serve an image based on this
            2) based on the width of the viewport
                - loading in different versions of the same image based the viewport of your device
                - tablets, smartphones, computer monitors, etc. 
                - using lower quality images on high res devices can lead to issues with edge blurring
                - by supplying smaller images at different viewports you also allow for reduced bandwidth
                    - instead of sending a 100k file to a mobile device, you only send a 1k file
    
        What is srcset?
            - a list of one or more strings separated by commas indicating a set of 
              possible image sources for the user agent to use
            - browsers are mostly capable of using srcset, but ones such as IE do not all support it
                - because of this always include a default src attribute
            ex.
                Good for a set width
                    <img src="img/img-500.jpg" 
                        srcset="img/img-500.jpg,
                                img/img-1000.jpg 2x,
                                img/img-1500.jpg 3x"
                        alt="">
                         
                More practical
                    <img src="img/img-500.jpg" 
                        srcset="img/img-500.jpg 500w,
                                img/img-1000.jpg 1000w,
                                img/img-1500.jpg 1500w"
                        alt="">


    
    Formats & More



        JPG
            - a "lossy" format
            - it will compress images at varying quality levels (user specified)
            - does not support transparency
            - file sizes are very small in comparison to other compression formats
            - use cases
                - photographs

        PNG
            - a "lossless" compression format
            - no variance in quality as quality is preserved
            - supports transparency
            - file sizes are smaller than the original, but significantly larger than say JPG 
            - use cases
                - text, simple graphics, line art, and transparent images

        GIF
            - animated artwork
            - use cases
                - animations

        SVG 

        WebP
            - can save w/ or w/out compression (lossy or lossless)
            - lossless version of this will preserve transparency 
            - file sizes are significantly smaller than JPG or PNG
