JavaScript Design Patterns

    The most popular design patterns can be categorized in a number of ways
        
        Creational design patterns
            - these patterns are responsible for optimizing object creation
            - standard object creation can often lead to added unecessary complexity
            - some popular pattens:
                
                Abstract Factory Method
                    - used to provide the client with a  set of related or dependant objects
                    - the family of objects created by the factory are determined at run-time
                
                Builder
                    - used to create complex objects with constituent parts that must be created in the same order
                    - external class controls the construction
                
                Factory Method
                    - used to replace class constructors
                    - 

                Prototype
                
                Singleton


        Structural design patterns
            - these patterns have more to do with object relationships
            - they ensure that if one portion of the system needs to change, that it does not rock the entire system
            - some popular patterns:

                Adapter

                Bridge

                Composite

                Decorator

                Facade

                Flyweight

                Proxy

        Behavioral design patterns
            - these patterns recognize, implement, and improve communication between disparate objects in a system
            - ensure all parts of the system have synchronized information

                Chain of Responsibility

                Command

                Iterator

                Mediator

                Memento

                Observer

                State

                Visitor

        Concurrency design patterns
            - these patterns help manage multi-threaded programs 

                Active Object

                Nuclear Reaction

                Scheduler

        Architectural desing patterns
            - patterns used for architectural purposes

                MVC (model-view-controller)

                MVP (model-view-presenter)

                MVVM (model-view-view model)
