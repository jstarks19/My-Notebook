Functions in JavaScript


- Functions are a way of encapsulating a small (or large) piece of code that can be called on when needed
- they are modular in nature, meaning a very complex program can be composed of numerous small, simpler functions

- In JavaScript, a function is simply an object, and a first-class object at that
    - specifically, it is a Function object (a built-in object in JavaScript)
        - being an object means that a function can have it's own methods and properties
    - 'first-class' : you can treat it as a value (store it in a variable, send it into functions, etc.)



Function Types
    Standard : binds this
        function fun() {

        }

    Expression : binds this
        let fun = function() {

        }
    
    Arrow Functions : does not bind this
        let fun = () => {

        }
        OR 
        () => console.log('true')


    a function declaration is hoisted, but a function expression is not
