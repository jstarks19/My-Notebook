JavaScript In-Built functions, objects, constants, etc.


Built-in Functions
    - eval()                : evaluates a piece of JS code
    - isFinite()            : evaluates a number and returns the result of if it is finite or not
    - isNan()               : evaluates a number and returns the result of if it is NaN or not
    - parseFloat()          : parses a value as a floating point 
    - parseInt()            : parses a value as an integer, second param for number base (2, 8, 10, 16)
    - encodeURI()           : encodes certain disallowed URL characters 
    - encodeURIComponent()
    - decodeURI()           : decodes an encoded URI string
    - decodeURIComponent()
    

Built-in Objects

    Fundamental Objects
        Object
        Function
            .call vs .apply
                - calling the function in both cases
                - need to pass in this to the first arg in both cases
                - all remaining arguments are where the difference is
                    - in call, you can use a comma seperated list of args after the this
                    - in apply, it must be a list
        Boolean
        Symbol 

    Numbers & Dates
        Number 
        BigInt
        Math
            - Useful Constants
                - E, LN2, LN10, LOG2E, LOG10E, PI, SQRT1_2, SQRT2
        Date
            - use new Date() mainly
            - also Date.now() is good for an immediate time/date 

    Data Formats
        JSON 


    Errors
        Error
            - message and name are the big properties to know
