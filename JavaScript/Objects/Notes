Objects in JavaScript


    - Objects are at the core of the JavaScript language and could be considered the primary data structure in the language

    - JavaScript uses a 'prototype-based' object model rather than a class based object model
        - What does this mean?
            - In a class based system, classes define all of the properties for an instance of an object 
                - the class is an abstraction
                - the object is the instance of the class
            - In a prototype based system, there is no distinction like this
                - it has plain objects
                - an object is given an associated prototype which provides initial methods & properties for the object
                - this prototype can also be another object, giving the new object access to the other objects methods and properties


    - In JavaScript, you also have a notion of classes (ES2015), but it is mainly sugar on top of the prototype system 
        - so learn the prototype system before all else




    Defining Objects in JavaScript

        Object Literal
            - the simplest way to define an object is with the object literal syntax '{}'

        Object.create()
            - using the Object.create() inbuilt function create an object 
            - pass in the prototype as well as a property description 

        Object Classes
            - new to ES2015
            - basically syntactic sugar on Function constructors and prototypes 
        
        Constructor functions
            - using a constructor function to generate an object using the 'new' keyword    

        Factory Functions
            - basically using closures to define a set of properties and methods and only return the accessors
