Router

    - obviously we could put all of our routes in the same file, but this is difficult as the application grows
    - you can think of it as a mini application that is combined with other routes to build your application

    Syntax 
        const express = require('express');
        const router = express.Router();

        router.get('/person' (req, res) => {
            res.send("ALLL");
        });

    - adding middleware to a specific route
        - use 
            router.use((req,res,next)=>{ // some middleware function })
