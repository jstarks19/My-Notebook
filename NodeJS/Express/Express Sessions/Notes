Express Session 
    $ npm i express-session
    - no longer need cookie-parser to use sessions
    - this is a module for managing sessions in express 

    const session = require('express-session');
    app.use(session({ secret: 'thisisnotagoodsecret' })) 

    - now every time you get a request, there will be a session object attatched to it
        - you can access it with req.session
        - you can also assign properties to it, in order to keep stateful information 
            - req.session.name = "Jason"
        - all stored serverside 

    - two primary settings associated with sessions
        - resave
            - basically this says that regardless of if the session object was updated, resave it to the session store on every request
        - saveUninitialized
            - forces a new and unmodified session to be stored in the session store on creation
