Flash

    $ npm i connect-flash

    - this is a middleware for express which allows for the showing of temporary messages which do not persist on refresh/revisit
        ex. you create a new product, or login, you get a message that "flashes" for creating the product, but it shouldn't persist
    
    - before sending a response or rendering
        - req.flash('success', 'Successfully Added Item')
