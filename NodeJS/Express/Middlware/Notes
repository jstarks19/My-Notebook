Middleware in Express

    - Basically the building block of express
    - they are middlemen in between the request and response 
    
    Overall
        - they are just functions
        - each middleware has access to the req and res
        - middleware can end the HTTP request by sending back a response with methods like res.send()
        - OR middleware can be chained together, one after another by calling next()
    

    Example Middleware
        - morgan
            - a logging module that will log to console http requests
            - a number of options you can use to improve the usefulness of the logging
    
    Creating Middleware
        app.get((req,res,next) => {
            next();
        });

        404 Not Found Middleware
            - place a the end of your app
            app.use((req,res) => {
                res.send('Not Found');
            });
