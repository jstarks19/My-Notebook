Library vs. Framework
    - Library
        - a library provides YOU with a number of properties and methods, YOU are in control...
    - Framework
        - a framework the control is with the FRAMEWORK, you interface with the framework
            - you are writing within the spec of the framework, you are a participant
        - this is because frameworks are designed to allow you to create full-scale apps
            - they don't just provide a few useful methods, they are the spec to which you create your app 

Express
    - A lightweight and fast minimalist web framework for Node.js
    - It is an NPM package, which provides us with a number of methods and properties
    - Helps us to:
        - Start up a server to listen for requests
        - Parse incoming requests
        - Match those requests to particular routes
        - Craft our http response and associated content
    - app.use : with a callback this will call on any request 


Requests & Response
    - req: incoming  
        - req.params
        - req.query
    - res: outgoing

Serving Static Assets
    - This is a middleware function 
    - app.use(express.static('public'));
    - This introduces the same issues that views does with being in the right directory during serving 
    - To counter this, we do the same thing, that is app.set('public', path.join(__dirname, '/public'))
