GET vs POST

    - GET 
        - used to retrieve information
        - data is sent via query string
        - information is plainly visible in the URL
        - limited in the amount of data that we can send
    
    - POST
        - used to post new data to the server
        - used to write/create/update
        - data is sent via request body, not through a query string
        - can send anything (JSON, HTML, Text, etc.)

    - req.body
        - this holds the body data of our http request
        - it is not populated by default
        - in order to populate it, we must use middleware
            - specifically we use 
                app.use(express.json())                         : for parsing application/json formatted data
                app.use(express.urlencoded({extended: true}))   : for parsing application/x-www-form-urlencoded
            - by default, without this middleware, req.body will be undefined

REST
    - Representational State Transfer
        - basically, it is a set of guidelines for how a client + server should communicate and perform CRUD operations on a given resource
        - a 'Restful' system is one that adheres to these guidlines

Express Redirects
    - instead of res.send or res.render
    - if we use res.redirect() and give it a route path, you can redirect to that route

UUID
    - an npm package for generating new unique ids
