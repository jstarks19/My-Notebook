Templating

    - In order to template you would use a templating engine
        - Templating engines include (some):
            - EJS (below)
            - Pug
            - HandleBars
            - Jade
            - Nunjucks
        - to set the template
            - app.set(name, value) :  set properties of the application

    - Templates should be as stupid as possible, do not over complicate them
        - put simple functional code snippets in them 
        - handle the big boy logic in JS
    

EJS
    - <%= %> : standard syntax for inserting a piece of embedded javascript into our ejs files 
        - nod is that it is rendered, so anything in here, once evaluated, will be visible 
    - <% %> : standard syntax for inserting a piece of JS code, which will not be rendered
        - used for control flow, if this then that other wise this 

    Loops
        - <% for (let elem of elems)%>

    Partials
        - include a piece of ejs code in a bunch of files, all templates 
        - <%- include('<path name') %>
        - the above includes that partial ejs code in the location of the tags and renders it 
        - ex. footer buttons, navbars, sidebars, etc.
