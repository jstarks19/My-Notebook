Object Oriented Programming

    - A paradigm based on the concept of Objects 
        - we divide programs into smaller pieces, which are each responsible for managing their own state

    
    Interfaces
        - basically like blueprints for a given object
            - it says that this object needs to have these methods and these properties
        
        JavaScript: No real notion of Interfaces. JavaScript is SO dynamically typed that there is no real ability to make the objects conform
            - typescript supports them

    Methods
        - a method is a function assigned to a specific object
        - when calling a method the 'this' keyword references the instance calling the method
        - you can explicitly define what this is referring to by using call, obj.call(obj, name);
        - the function keyword creates "this"
            - using arrow functions always delegates to the scope above 




    - Points
        - you can remember with "APIE"
        
        1) Abstraction
            - only exposing necessary details for anyone using the object 
            - decouples the user from the implementation 
        2) Polymorphism
            - this is basically the notion that multiple sub classes can hold different properties
                - however, when using the parent class to reference these, you still get out different properties
                - despite a car and plane being vehicles, they have another form in that their methods for move() differ
            
        3) Inheritance
            - Utilizing the methods and properties of another class in the one you are creating
                - ex. a vehicle moves, so subclasses such as Car, Train, Bike, Plane all could inherit that property
                    - however, the method of movement might differ between them, so you would add something specific to each of the classes
                    - but they all still 'inherit' that initial move state/property 
            - Classes which extend others are called 
                - sub class, child class, extended class
            - Classes which are extended to others are known as 
                - super class, parent class, base class 

        4) Encapsulation
