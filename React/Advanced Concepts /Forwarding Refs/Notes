Forwarding Refs in React


    - A technique used to pass a ref from a parent component to its children 
    

    Here are the main steps

        1) The Parent component creates a ref within its constructor

        2) This ref is attatched to a child component (CLASS)

        3) Within the Child Component Class, we need to use the passed in ref
            - we can do this with React.forwardRef
                - this function takes in a functional component, and has params (props, ref)
                - now we attatch the passed in ref to the element we are looking to reference
            
            ex. 

            const FunctionalComp = React.forwardRef((props, ref) => {
                return (
                    <div>
                        <input type="text" ref={ref} />
                    </div>
                )
            })

            export default FunctionalComp
        
        4) Now the Parent Component is able to access the element of the Child Component directly
