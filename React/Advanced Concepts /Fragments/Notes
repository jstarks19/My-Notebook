React Fragments


    - When returning JSX from components, you need to group every piece of JSX into one enclosing tag
        - even if the content doesn't necessarily need to be grouped, you still need one element to wrap everything in when returning
    
    What does a fragment do?
        - It allows you to group a number of children elements, without adding extra nodes to the DOM
        - So you can return a grouping, without necessarily needing an enclosing element/node
        - syntax
            open    : <>    || <React.Fragment>
            close   : </>   || </React.Fragment>
        
        - Will not add a new node to the DOM!
        - can use the key attribute in a fragment tag (specifically, the React.Fragment tags)
    
    Practical Use Case
        - making a table column it's own component
            - embedding that column in the table row
        - we can't have our column in a containing node, since it would be a child of the tr element
