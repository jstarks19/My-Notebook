React Portals

    - This is a way to render DOM nodes outside of the primary DOM root parent
    

    - Most/all of the content for your app is often rendered under the main #root HTML element
        - portals give us a portal into the rest of the DOM 
    
    To use
        - make sure to import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
        - now, when returning our component's JSX, instead return...

            return ReactDOM.createPortal(<JSX>, document.getElementById("id"));
        
        - we return the ReactDOM.createPortal method
            - where arg 1 is the JSX to return, and arg 2 is the selector/reference for the dom node
            - technically, the 1st arg can be anything react knows how to render, so numbers, strings, jsx, etc. 


    Why would we need them?
        - a good use case would be a modal, that you need your user to interact with
            - when rendering the modal, you want it to grey out the entire background, not just your app
            - also, when you set fixed sizes on the modal, it can break the app's layout


    One cool thing to note
        - Portals still support event bubbling
            - this means that interaction with an element rendered outside of the dom hierarchy will still propogate upwards in the Component hierarchy
