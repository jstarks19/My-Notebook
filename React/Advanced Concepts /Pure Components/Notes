Pure Components in React

    - It is an imported object, so you must do
        - import React, { PureComponent } from 'react'

    - The class component then extends the PureComponent

    Difference Between Pure & Regular Components

        Regular Component
            - A regular component does not implement the shouldComponentUpdate method
                - it will always return true by default

        Pure Component
            -  Always implements shouldComponentUpdate 
                - using a shallow comparison of both state and props
            - Compares prevState w/ currentState & prevProps w/ currentProps
            - Only updates when the comparison shows a difference 
            
            Shallow Comparison?
                - primitives
                    - are A and B the same type & have the same value
                - complex types
                    - are A and B referencing the same object

            Why use Pure Components?
                - they can provide a performance boost by preventing unecessary rerenders
                - if you are mass updating a list and some of the components within that list are not changing, whby rerender them?
                - or maybe data you fetched has not been updated at this point, no use in rerendering the data
