Layout Out a React App


    App
        - It is a general convention to have a single top level component called App
            - App is responsible for rendering all of the other components
            - this is the general convention so best not to deviate too much 

    Components
        - Each React component should go in a seperate file
            - the name of the file should be <Component Name>.js
                - where component name is capitalized
            - they can be placed in their own components folder, and further divided into subdirectories if needed
        - Components extend Component, which is imported from React (unless using hooks)
            - the component should be exported as the default object
 
        
    CSS Conventions
        - generally you should make a CSS file for each component
            - if component is Component.js, you should in turn make Component.css 
        - import the css for the given component at the top of that component's js file
        - label the main returned component div with className = <component name>
            - every subclass within this component should be prefixed with the component name
            i.e. Component
                    - Component-title
