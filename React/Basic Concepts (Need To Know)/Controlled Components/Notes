Controlled Components

    Controlled Components allow for the programmer to capture the state of input/form elements


    - The main idea here is to keep track of a form's state within a component
        - more specifically, it is about keeping track of an input's state in general
        - when I say, keep track of state, I mean literally to have an onChange event on each input
            - this way, you can handle updating the input state value in the onChange handler 
            - this is useful as when you need to package and send data, say in a JSON format, it will be much easier to grab your values directly from your state
    
    - Other cool uses are for real time output of your input, such as a type along or searching on onChange
