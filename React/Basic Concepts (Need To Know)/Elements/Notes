Elements

    An element describes what you want to see on the screen

    Note: elements are not components, components are composed of elements


    An Example
        - if there is a div in your HTML file
            i.e. <div id="root"></div>
        - we refer to this as a 'root' DOM node, because everything within it will be managed by the React DOM
        
    - react elements are immutable
        - meaning, once they are created, they and their children cannot be changed (nor can their attributes)
        - think of an element as a single frame of a movie
    
    - in practice, most react apps only call ReactDOM.render() once 
    - react will only ever update what is necessary to update
        - react compares it's current state to it's previous state and makes minimum adjustments to the DOM 
        - in general, it is better to think about the current state & states in general as frames in an animation
