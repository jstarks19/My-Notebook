Styling React Components


    - There are a number of ways in which we can go about styling React Components
        - Specifically, let's cover 4

            1) CSS Stylesheets
                - use a standard css stylesheet
                - need to import the given stylesheet to your react project or 
                    - you can also include it within your root HTML file, if you have one
            2) Inline Styling
                - styles that are applied inline to the element
                - in order to use a style inline, in must be placed within a JS object
                - unfortunately, since JS doesn't allow kebab-case, you must use the camel case versions of property names
            3) CSS Modules
                - available through react-scripts 
            4) CSS in JS Libraries (Styled Components)
