Create React App    

    - a way of generating boilerplate for our React apps
    - it is a utility script
    - sets up your js files to run through Babel automatically
    - allows for us to use modern JavaScript features/idioms
    - makes testing & deployment very easy

    - NOTE: IT IS AN OFFICIAL SCRIPT, not just a side-project or third-party app
