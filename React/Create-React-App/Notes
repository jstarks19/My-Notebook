Create React App    

    - a way of generating boilerplate for our React apps
    - it is a utility script
    - sets up your js files to run through Babel automatically
    - allows for us to use modern JavaScript features/idioms
    - makes testing & deployment very easy

    - NOTE: IT IS AN OFFICIAL SCRIPT, not just a side-project or third-party app 


    - Two ways to install CRA
        1) sudo npm i -g create-react-app
            $ create-react-app <app-name> 
        2) npx create-react-app <app-name>
    
    - How to start App
        $ npm start
    
    - Conventions
        - Each React component should go in a seperate file
            - the name of the file should be <Component Name>.js
                - where component name is capitalized
            - they can be placed in their own components folder, and further divided into subdirectories if needed
        - Components extend Component, which is imported from React (unless using hooks)
            - the component should be exported as the default object
        - The boilerplate assumes the top object is App in App.js
            - might as well stick to this
        
        CSS Conventions
            - generally you should make a CSS file for each component
                - if component is Component.js, you should in turn make Component.css 
            - import the css for the given component at the top of that component's js file
            - label the main returned component div with className = <component name>
                - every subclass within this component should be prefixed with the component name
                i.e. Component
                        - Component-title
