JSX - JavaScript Syntax Extension



    This is basically JavaScript and XML/HTML combined
        - it looks a lot like a templating language, though it offers the full power of JavaScript
    
    - instead of seperating technologies, by including their markup & logic in seperate files
        - React decides to seperate concerns, by using Components which contain both the Markup and the Logic for elements
    - JSX is always escaped before rendering
        - this entirely prevents XSS attacks from occurring

    - Babel is what helps us compile JSX calls down to pure JavaScript

    - To embed regular JavaScript into JSX we must use curly braces 
        i.e. <h1> My name is {getName()} </h1>
    
    - Common practice for inserting a number of items from a list
        - is to use array.map(fn)
