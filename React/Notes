React JS

    - Developed by and sponsored by Facebook
    - refers to itself as a library

    - what is react's selling point?
        - components!
        - these are modular pieces of reusable code that encapsulate the logic and HTML into a single class
        - make it very easy to build modular applications
    
    - what is different about components?
        - unlike the standard big three (HTML, CSS, yadda yadda)
            - react's components often incorporate all three of these in a single 'component'
    
    Library vs. Framework
        - a framework for web dev is characterized by
            - Larger JS Libraries
            - Provide "blueprint" for apps 
            - "Opinionated"
                - "This is how you should design a JS app"
            - often provide a templating system 
    
    Popular Frameworks
        - Angular
        - Vue
        - React?
            - I would consider React to be a Library on its own
                - it is good at creating components
                - aside from this, it is relatively unopinionated
            - However, very few people just use plain old react
            - Usually it is combined with other tools such as React Router, Webpack, Redux, etc.
            - The standard "React Ecosystem" with all of the mixins would be considered a Framework
            - Next.js is actually a framework built around React 
    
    Why would you want to use it?
        - Structure the 'view' layer of your application 
        - Provides reusable components with their own state
        - JSX - Dynamic Markup
        - Interactive UIs w/ Virtual DOM
        - Performance & Testing
        - Very very popular in the industry right now
