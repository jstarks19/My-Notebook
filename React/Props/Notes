Properties in React

    - in order to pass properties down to components, we use the standard HTML syntax for setting attributes
        ex. <Hello to="Ringo" />
    
    - properties are immutable
        - CRUCIAL!
        - you cannot change these, they are read-only
        - we also cannot add values to props
    
    - what types of data can we pass as properties?
        - basically anything
        - use braces to pass more complicated data into our components

    - defining default props
        - create a static defaultProps object containing the default properties
