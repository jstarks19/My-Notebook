State

    - state is similar to props, however it is private and fully controlled by the given component
    - it is the internal data specific to a given component

    Component Class
        
        - you initialize state in the constructor
            ex. this.state = etc. 
        - and you update state using
            this.setState({statename: value})
        - you will often want to keep track of several states at a time within a component 
        - if the component you are working with is stateless
            - you can omit the constructor
        - should call super(props) in your component's constructor
            - this will 'register' this component as an actual React component
