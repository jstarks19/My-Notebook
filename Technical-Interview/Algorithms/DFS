Depth First Search

- This is an algorithm that is quite useful and easy to implement
- It is a must-know for programming interviews


How does it work?

    - we explore one branch of our graph/tree, and then the next branch, and the next
    
    - say we wanted to explore a tree with DFS and store all the values in DFS order
        - we would:
        1) Add the current node value to the array
        2) For each of our children, we call the function recursively, passing in our array 


Space & Time Complexity

    variables

        V : vertices
        E : edges


    Space : O(V)
        - We are traversing all of the branches, meaning we have (V) frames on the callstack in worst case
        - In general it would likely be under this, but in worst case O(V) for sure

    Time : O(V + E)
        - This is really subtle
        - At every level we are iterating through E children, since we have E outgoing edges
        - Additionally, we are visting every node in the tree, every vertice V
        - Thus, we spend O(V + E) on our algorithm
